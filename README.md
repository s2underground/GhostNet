GhostNet
=====
GhostNet is the overarching term for a collection of communications networks set up to allow users
around the world to exchange information without relying on pre-established infrastructure. Far from
being just an emergency plan, GhostNet is intended to ease the transition of radio technology into everyday
life. Though radio networks cannot truly replace the internet, we hope that we can replace a substantial
portion of a person’s daily information requirements, and promote a culture of off-grid information sharing.
